# Prediction of Bike Sharing Demand

# Problem Statement
 ## Use-Case
    A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
 ## Problem
    A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
 ## Requirement
    1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    2. How well those variables describe the bike demands.
## Goal
    1. Develop a model to find the variables which are significant the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
    2.It will be used by the management to understand and manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
